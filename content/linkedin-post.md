# LinkedIn Post - Developer Introduction

You probably have a dozen technical problems that aren't getting solved because your team is stretched thin.

I specialize in being the person who takes those problems off your plate.

## Here's what I do well:

• Build production e-commerce platforms (checkout flows, payment processing, order management)

• Automate manual workflows that waste your team's time

• Integrate AI features that actually add value (RAG systems, semantic search, chatbots)

• Write tests so bugs get caught before customers see them

• Communicate in plain language — no jargon walls

## Recent work:

Complete e-commerce platform with AI chatbot, appointment booking, and admin dashboards.

137 automated tests covering the full user journey.

---

## What makes me different:

My background (Army paramedic → Toyota Finance Manager → Full-stack developer) means I understand both the technical work and the business reasons behind it.

If you're tired of developers who over-promise and under-deliver, let's talk.

I'd rather show you what I've built than tell you what I can do.
