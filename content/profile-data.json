When AI makes sense for your project, I build RAG systems with semantic search, vector databases, and responses grounded in your data.\n\nNeed data from somewhere it doesn't want to go? I build web scraping pipelines that collect, clean, and feed information into whatever system needs it. Need manual processes to disappear? I write automation that handles the repetitive work so your team can focus on what matters.\n\nWhat I bring beyond the technical:\n\nI ask the right questions before writing code. Years of high-pressure decision-making taught me that understanding the problem saves everyone time and money. I think about who's using what I build, not just whether it works, but whether it makes sense to them.\n\nI communicate clearly because I've spent years translating complex information for people who aren't technical. I document my work so the next person isn't guessing. I meet deadlines because I've worked in environments where missing them wasn't an option.\n\nIf you're looking for a developer who ships reliable software and is genuinely easy to work with, let's connect.

Appointments trigger after payment.\n\nAI chatbot using RAG that understands context. Semantic search via Supabase pgvector, natural responses via OpenAI.

      "content": "You probably have a dozen technical problems that aren't getting solved because your team is stretched thin.\n\nI specialize in being the person who takes those problems off your plate.\n\n---\n\nHere's what I do well:\n\n• Build e-commerce platforms (checkout flows, payment processing, order management)\n\n• Automate manual workflows that waste your team's time\n\n• Integrate AI features that add value (RAG systems, semantic search, chatbots)\n\n• Write tests so bugs get caught before customers see them\n\n• Communicate in plain language, no jargon walls\n\n---\n\nRecent work:\n\nComplete e-commerce platform with AI chatbot, appointment booking, and admin dashboards.\n\n137 automated tests covering the full user journey.\n\n---\n\nWhat makes me different:\n\nMy background (Army paramedic → Toyota Finance Manager → Full-stack developer) means I understand both the technical work and the business reasons behind it.\n\nIf you're tired of developers who over-promise and under-deliver, let's talk. I'd rather show you what I've built than tell you what I can do."

      "frontend_design": "I have built responsive React and Vue.js applications demonstrating strong front-end fundamentals. In my work at needthisdone.com, I implemented WCAG AA accessibility compliance across all components, comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright, and dark mode cross-compatibility.",
      "ai_integration": "I have successfully integrated modern AI tooling into production applications. At Acadio, I used Claude Code to build systems that dramatically reduced manual work. On needthisdone.com, I implemented context-aware chatbots using Supabase pgvector semantic search and OpenAI embeddings, demonstrating practical understanding of RAG patterns and LLM integration."
