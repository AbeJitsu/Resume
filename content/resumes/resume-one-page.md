## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Career built on discipline and proven growth: Army paramedic (5 years) making life-or-death decisions under pressure, then Toyota (7 years) advancing through three roles to Finance Manager. That foundation of leadership, systematic thinking, and earning trust through results now drives software development work.

Transitioned to software development in 2023 with the same commitment that earned promotions at Toyota and kept patients alive in the Army. Systematic problem-solver influenced by algorithmic thinking and computational approaches to decision-making.

## FEATURED PROJECT

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**needthisdone.com** | *Co-Founder & Full-Stack Developer | November 2025 - Present*

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Production e-commerce platform:** Complete system with shopping flows, user authentication, order management, admin dashboard, and component-based page builder so non-technical users can create pages without code. Built with a layered architecture that handles traffic, business logic, and data separately - making the system faster and easier to maintain. Smart indexing ensures pages load quickly by only updating what's changed. Handles live traffic and processes actual payments.

**Testing & quality:** Comprehensive testing that simulates real customer behavior - from browsing products to completing checkout. Accessibility verified to ensure the site works for users with disabilities. Tests run automatically before every release.

**Infrastructure:** Professional development environment that mirrors production, preventing "works on my machine" problems. Automated deployment pipeline ensures every change is tested before going live. Shared design system with Storybook component library. Admin dashboard with system monitoring, user management, and real-time status indicators. Dark mode implemented and tested throughout.

**AI-powered features:** Built context-aware chatbot using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern - combines semantic search via Supabase pgvector with OpenAI API for intelligent responses. System generates embeddings from content, stores vectors in PostgreSQL, and retrieves contextually relevant information to answer user questions naturally. Includes intelligent indexing with hash-based change detection to keep chatbot knowledge current. Demonstrates prompt engineering to optimize response quality and relevance.
