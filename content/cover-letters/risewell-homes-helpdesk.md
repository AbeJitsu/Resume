Dear Hiring Team,

Risewell Homes needs IT support that keeps employees productive and systems running smoothly. For decades, I've been the go-to person for solving technical problems—from troubleshooting hardware failures to fixing software issues to diagnosing network connectivity problems. My full-stack development background has sharpened this further: I systematically troubleshoot across frontend applications, backend servers, database connectivity, deployment pipelines, and network configurations. That's the same problem-solving approach helpdesk work requires.

My customer service experience from Toyota (where I advanced through three roles) and Full Sail University taught me how to work with non-technical people under pressure. I can explain technical concepts clearly, stay patient when users are frustrated, and document solutions so problems get resolved faster next time. I've used ticketing systems to track issues, written user guides and troubleshooting procedures, and handled hardware diagnostics. I understand what it takes to support people effectively.

The job description mentions Windows 11, Azure, and Cisco Meraki as preferred—I don't have professional experience with those specific tools, but I pick up new systems quickly. I learned full-stack development by understanding fundamentals and applying them to new environments. That same approach works for IT support: understand the system, diagnose the problem, fix it, document it.

I'm based in Orlando, so the hybrid setup works perfectly. Let me know if you'd like to discuss how my troubleshooting experience and customer service background fit your team's needs.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

**Abiezer "Abe" Reyes**
