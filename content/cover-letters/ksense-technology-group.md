Dear Hiring Team,

I saw your posting for the TypeScript Developer role and it caught my attention. The tools you're using are the same ones I work with every day, and your focus on quality work for diverse clients sounds like where I do my best work.

**What I bring to your team:**

I started learning web development in 2016 and went full-time in 2023. That's eight years of building, first while working full-time at Toyota, then professionally at Acadio and running my own business. The technologies you're looking for are the ones I use every day:

- **TypeScript & Next.js:** Built needthisdone.com from scratch, an e-commerce site that processes payments and serves customers, backed by over 100 automated tests.

- **Express.js:** Built APIs and backend services for client projects. Server-side work feels like home.

- **Vue.js:** Learned Vue through hands-on projects and freelance work. Quick to pick up new frameworks.

- **Git & Code Quality:** Code reviews and automated testing are just how I work. Tests matter because untested code breaks at the worst times.

**Recent work that shows what I can do:**

At Acadio, the team was spending hours on manual data work. After building tools to automate the repetitive stuff, I became the go-to person when something tricky needed figuring out. That's a role that comes naturally: taking problems off the team's plate.

Needthisdone.com is my business. Built the whole stack from the ground up: website, server, database, payment system. Happy to walk through how it works in the technical interview.

**Why this role makes sense:**

I've built my career on earning trust through results. Three promotions at Toyota. Five years as an Army medic where attention to detail kept people alive. That foundation shows up in how I write code. I own what I build, I communicate clearly, and I do what I say I'll do.

Your job description mentions "strong sense of ownership and pride in your work." That's how I operate. I'm looking for a team where I can do good work, pick up whatever tools the project needs, and grow into more responsibility over time.

I'm ready for the technical assessment and would love to show you around needthisdone.com in the interview. Thanks for reading, and looking forward to chatting.
