Dear Hiring Team,

I'm applying for the Mid-Level Full Stack TypeScript Developer position at Ksense Technology Group. Your tech stack matches what I build with every day, and your focus on delivering quality work for diverse clients sounds like exactly the kind of environment where I do my best work.

**What I bring to your team:**

I've been learning web development since 2016 and went full-time as a developer in 2023. That means eight years of building, first while working full-time at Toyota, then professionally at Acadio and on my own production platform. The technologies you're looking for are the ones I use daily:

- **TypeScript & Next.js:** Built needthisdone.com, a production e-commerce platform handling real traffic and payments. Next.js 14, TypeScript throughout, over 100 automated tests.

- **Express.js:** Server-side development experience building APIs and backend services.

- **Vue.js:** Completed comprehensive training (Schwarzmüller's Complete Guide) and used Vue in freelance projects. Comfortable with the Composition API and Vue ecosystem.

- **Git & Code Quality:** Professional workflow with feature branches, pull requests, and CI/CD. I write tests because I've learned the hard way that untested code breaks at the worst times.

**Recent work that shows what I can do:**

At Acadio, I joined a team that was spending hours on manual data work. I automated validation pipelines, built web scraping infrastructure for FINRA regulations, and became the go-to person when something tricky needed to be figured out. That's the role I naturally fall into: someone who takes problems off the team's plate.

On needthisdone.com, I built everything from the ground up: frontend components, backend APIs, database design, payment processing, and deployment infrastructure. It's not a portfolio piece. It handles real customers and real payments. I'd be happy to walk through the architecture in the technical interview.

**Why this role makes sense:**

I've spent my career earning trust through results. Three promotions at Toyota. Five years as an Army medic where attention to detail wasn't optional. That foundation shows up in how I approach code: I take ownership, I communicate clearly, and I deliver what I promise.

Your job description mentions "strong sense of ownership and pride in your work." That's exactly how I operate. I'm looking for a team where I can contribute meaningfully, learn from experienced developers, and grow into more responsibility over time.

I'm ready to complete the technical assessment and would welcome the chance to present my needthisdone.com project in the technical interview. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
