Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the PHP Developer position at Travel Media Group. While my professional background is in full-stack Node.js development, I have built the same systems your team needs—data pipelines, API integrations, responsive frontends, and production infrastructure. I'm ready to bring this proven expertise to PHP and Symfony, and I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to your reputation, social media, and AI-driven hospitality platforms.

### Why I'm Ready for This Role

At Acadio (an EdTech LMS platform), I built automated data pipelines with web scraping infrastructure to ingest FINRA regulations and course content, then fed that data into AI systems to generate quality questions and flashcards at scale. This is exactly the kind of work Travel Media Group does—scraping hotel data, ingesting third-party APIs, and powering platforms that impact thousands of businesses. I understand how to architect systems where data flows cleanly from source → processing → consumption, and I've done it at production scale.

Your job description emphasizes web scraping tools like Puppeteer, Guzzle, and cURL. I have hands-on Puppeteer experience for browser automation and data extraction. More importantly, I understand the problem these tools solve: efficiently gathering and transforming data from external sources. That's a transferable skill regardless of language.

### Experience That Directly Matches Your Needs

I reviewed your requirements and my background addresses them directly:

- **Data pipelines & scraping:** Built automated ingestion systems that reduced manual data gathering from hours to minutes. Experience with structured data extraction, transformation, and storage.
- **RESTful APIs:** Designed and consumed APIs across multiple projects (OAuth, OpenAI, Stripe, custom endpoints). Comfortable building both sides—creating APIs and integrating third-party ones.
- **Responsive design & front-end:** React, Vue.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS—all tested to WCAG AA accessibility standards. Your job requires responsive, accessible interfaces; I've shipped this at scale.
- **Database design:** PostgreSQL and MongoDB experience with query optimization, indexing, and efficient data modeling. MySQL is straightforward from this foundation.
- **Git & version control:** Professional workflow across multiple projects (branching strategy, code review, collaborative development).
- **Problem-solving under pressure:** At Acadio, I became the primary technical problem-solver, tackling challenges others struggled with. I'm comfortable diving into unfamiliar codebases and systems.

### On the Framework Question

You're looking for someone with Symfony or Laravel experience. I don't have professional Symfony background, but I have something more valuable: deep understanding of how web frameworks work. Express.js (which I use) and Symfony are both MVC frameworks. The patterns are similar—routing, controllers, middleware, models, views. I've moved between React, Vue.js, and Angular. I've learned new frameworks quickly because I understand the fundamentals.

What matters more is that I understand the problems these frameworks solve. At needthisdone.com, I architected a three-tier system with layered separation of concerns—data layer, business logic, presentation layer. That's the thinking Symfony is built around. I'm not intimidated by the framework; I'm ready to apply what I already know to your codebase.

### Why Travel Media Group

I'm based in Orlando, FL—Maitland is perfect for me. More importantly, your platform interests me. You're doing real work that impacts thousands of hotels and management companies. You're integrating APIs, handling data at scale, and building AI-driven features. That's meaningful technical work that requires problem-solvers, not just developers who know one language.

I'm genuinely excited to contribute to this team and grow my expertise in the process.

### Next Steps

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my full-stack expertise, data pipeline experience, and proven ability to solve complex problems can contribute to Travel Media Group's success. I'm ready to provide code samples, GitHub links, and discuss my approach to learning Symfony in a professional environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,
