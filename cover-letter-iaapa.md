Dear IAAPA Hiring Team,

I'm applying for the Web Application Developer position on your Digital Platforms team. I build and maintain content-driven web platforms, and I'd be excited to contribute to IAAPA's global digital presence.

**What I bring:**

My primary stack is JavaScript and TypeScript. I work daily with React, Next.js, and Node.js, building features, integrating APIs, and maintaining platforms in production. I'm familiar with PHP and Drupal from earlier projects, and I'm confident I can expand those skills quickly.

Here's why: I use AI-assisted development every day. Your job posting specifically mentions "agentic tools for planning, scaffolding, and iterative refinement with human review." That's exactly how I work. Claude Code is part of my daily workflow, and it means I can pick up new frameworks and patterns much faster than traditional learning curves would suggest.

I also have direct experience with Salesforce CRM from my time at Full Sail University, where I used it daily for enrollment tracking and cross-department coordination. That background should help with the Salesforce integrations you mentioned.

**Why this role fits:**

I live in Orlando and I'm comfortable with the 4-day in-office schedule. Cross-functional collaboration is familiar territory. Before tech, I spent seven years at Toyota managing daily client interactions under tight deadlines, and I led teams in the Army where clear communication was essential.

I care about accessibility (WCAG AA is standard in my work) and I understand that global platforms need to perform reliably across regions.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how I can support IAAPA's digital platforms.

Best,
Abe Reyes
