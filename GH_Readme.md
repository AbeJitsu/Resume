## Full-Stack Developer

Career built on discipline and proven growth: Army paramedic making life-or-death decisions under pressure, then Toyota advancing through three roles to Finance Manager. That foundation of leadership, systematic thinking, and earning trust through results now drives my software development work.

Currently building production systems and automation tools that solve real problems.
