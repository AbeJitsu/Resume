I build full-stack JavaScript applications with Node.js, React, and Express. I've shipped production apps with real-time features, REST APIs, and third-party integrations. I can start immediately and am available for 30+ hours per week.

## Screening Questions

### 1. What is your experience with converting legacy PHP applications to NodeJS?

I have conceptual understanding of PHP architecture from studying legacy codebases, which helps me identify patterns that need modernization. While I haven't led a full PHP-to-Node migration, I bring strong Node.js and Express skills that translate directly to building the replacement layer. I'm comfortable reviewing PHP code to understand existing logic and implementing equivalent (or improved) functionality in Node.

### 2. Describe your recent experience with similar projects

**Vue.js + Express E-Commerce Platform:** Built a full-stack e-commerce application with Vue.js on the frontend and Express/Node.js on the backend. Designed RESTful APIs, implemented authentication, and integrated MongoDB for product, order, and user management.

**needthisdone.com (Live Production Site):** React/Next.js application with Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database. Includes real-time features, Stripe payment integration, and automated E2E testing with Playwright. Maintained in CI/CD pipeline.

**Acadio (EdTech Client):** Gathered requirements from stakeholders, developed features, and provided support for platform issues. Worked across the full stack to troubleshoot and resolve complex bugs.

### 3. Include a link to your GitHub profile and/or website

- **GitHub:** github.com/AbeJitsu
- **Portfolio:** needthisdone.com

### 4. What frameworks have you worked with?

**Frontend:** React, Vue.js, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, REST APIs, WebSocket
**Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase
**Testing:** Playwright (E2E), Vitest (Unit)
**Tools:** Git, CI/CD pipelines, Storybook

### 5. Describe your approach to testing and improving QA

I use a layered testing approach:

- **E2E Testing (Playwright):** Automated browser tests that verify critical user flows work end-to-end
- **Unit Testing (Vitest):** Fast tests for individual functions and components
- **CI/CD Integration:** Tests run automatically on every push, blocking merges that break existing functionality
- **Code Reviews:** I follow development standards and review code for maintainability, not just functionality

This approach catches bugs early and gives confidence when refactoring or adding features.
