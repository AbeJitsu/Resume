# Cover Letter — Lockheed Martin AI Software Engineer Sr

**Position:** AI Software Engineer Sr (Job ID: 713539BR)
**Locations:** Fort Worth, TX | King of Prussia, PA | Littleton, CO | Orlando, FL
**Team:** AI Factory Apps, Enterprise Operations

---

Dear Hiring Team,

The AI Factory Apps team is building tools that thousands of Lockheed Martin employees will use daily. That's the kind of work that gets me excited: software that genuinely makes people's jobs easier.

**Here's what stands out about this role:**

Your listing mentions MCP (Model Context Protocol) as a desired skill. Most developers haven't touched it yet. My daily workflow already includes context7 MCP for pulling live documentation. It's muscle memory at this point.

The focus on AI utilities integrated into MS Office applications also resonates. At Acadio, an EdTech platform, the challenge was similar: take complex data (FINRA regulations), run it through AI systems, and produce content that non-technical users could actually work with. The web scraping infrastructure and automated generation pipelines reduced what used to take weeks down to minutes.

**On the technical side:**

My daily stack is JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, with Next.js and Supabase on the backend. I've built RAG systems with pgvector and OpenAI embeddings, written E2E tests with Playwright, and made accessibility a priority (WCAG AA). Currently learning Go.

**Beyond the technical:**

Five years as an Army paramedic built the discipline to stay calm when things break. Seven years at Toyota, advancing from sales to Finance Manager, developed the communication skills to explain complex information clearly. Both experiences taught the same lesson: the best solutions are the ones that work for the people using them.

**Location:** Based in Orlando (one of your listed locations) and comfortable with full-time remote work and periodic travel.

The opportunity to build AI tools that help Lockheed Martin employees work more effectively is genuinely exciting. Would love to chat about how this experience fits what the team needs.

Thank you for your time.

Warm regards,
