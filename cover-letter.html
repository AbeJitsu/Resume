    <div class="salutation">Dear Hiring Manager,</div>

    <p>I'm writing about the React UI Frontend Developer position (12+ month contract, onsite in Orlando). I don't have 8+ years of professional frontend experience, but I've put in the reps building production software and would welcome the chance to demonstrate my capabilities through a demo project.</p>

    <p>My best work is at needthisdone.com (live production site with public GitHub repo at github.com/AbeJitsu/Need_This_Done). I built it from scratch with React, Next.js, and TypeScript: over 160 components, over 70 API routes, over 65 E2E test files covering full user journeys. The code shows I understand component architecture, state management (over 5 context providers), API integration, and accessibility. The platform achieves Lighthouse scores of 100% SEO, 100% Accessibility, and 75%+ Performance. GitHub Actions runs my CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and accessibility checks before each deployment.</p>

    <p>The role requires React.js, API integration, CSS, and unit testing with Jest. I use React hooks, Context API for state management, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. My testing includes Playwright E2E (equivalent to Cypress experience) and Vitest unit tests (equivalent to Jest). I've integrated Stripe payments, Google Calendar API, and built WCAG AA accessible interfaces. I'm currently building a real-time streaming chat interface for an automation dashboard, which demonstrates my ability to handle modern React patterns like server-sent events and optimistic UI updates.</p>

    <p>I know actions speak louder than resumes. If you'd like to see me solve a specific problem or build something for your team, I'm ready. Give me a real-world component challenge, an API integration task, or a performance optimization, and I'll show you how I work.</p>

    <p>I'm not asking you to take a chance on potential. I'm showing you production code that demonstrates I can do this work. I'm local to Orlando, available for onsite work, and ready to start. I'd love to discuss how my skills could contribute to your team.</p>
