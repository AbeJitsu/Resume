        RE: Wireless Sales Associate Position
    </div>

    <div class="body">
        <p>
            I saw your posting for a Wireless Sales Associate and it caught my attention right away. Face-to-face sales with uncapped commissions, working as part of a team to hit goals together? That's exactly the environment where I do my best work. I spent seven years at Toyota of Orlando doing exactly this, and I'm excited about the opportunity to bring that experience to your AT&T team.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Toyota, I started on the sales floor greeting customers and helping them find the right vehicle. I earned three promotions because I was good at one thing: making people feel comfortable. I'd walk them through features, explain promotions in plain language, and help them make decisions they felt confident about. My teammates would bring me their toughest customers because I had a knack for finding solutions and closing deals. In a commission-driven environment processing 10-30 customers daily, I consistently exceeded my sales goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I bring to your team is simple. I greet people warmly, I listen to understand what they actually need, and I explain options without pressure or jargon. I'm comfortable talking to anyone (I grew up in New York City), and I can connect with Spanish-speaking customers at a conversational level. Product demonstrations come naturally to me, whether I'm explaining vehicle protection packages or wireless plans.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm also someone who makes the team better. At Toyota, I helped train newer salespeople and shared what was working for me. I believe in lifting everyone up because when the whole team wins, everyone benefits. That's the kind of energy I'd bring to your sales floor.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'd welcome the chance to meet in person and show you the same genuine, face-to-face approach that made me successful at Toyota. I'm ready to start contributing to your team's sales goals right away.
        </p>
