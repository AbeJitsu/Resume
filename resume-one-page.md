## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

I build complete full-stack systems from scratch—frontend, backend, database, infrastructure, testing, deployment. I solve complex technical problems that stump other developers. Co-founded needthisdone.com, a production platform handling payments, user authentication, and complex business logic with comprehensive testing. I architected the entire system myself. At Acadio, I identified manual workflows consuming weeks of team time and automated them away. Self-taught since 2023, consistently delivering measurable results.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Full-Stack Developer**
*Acadio | Educational LMS Platform | April 2025 - December 2025*

- Identified manual workflows consuming weeks of team time and automated them away using Claude Code—flashcard generation, validation, and correction now runs in minutes
- Built multi-phase validation pipelines that catch errors programmatically instead of requiring manual review
- Became the go-to problem-solver for complex technical challenges others couldn't resolve
