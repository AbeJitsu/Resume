        <div class="salutation">Dear Hiring Team,</div>

        <div class="body">
            <p>
                I'm applying for the Sales Representative position starting in January 2026. Your job posting describes someone who believes in what they're selling and connects customers to the right products for their needs. That's exactly how I've approached sales for the past twelve years.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Toyota of Orlando, I spent seven years selling insurance products. As Finance and Insurance Manager, I presented Vehicle Service Contracts, GAP coverage, and protection products to 3-7 customers daily. I didn't push products. I listened to what each customer needed, explained their options clearly, and helped them make informed decisions. That consultative approach earned me three promotions and a reputation as the person teammates called when deals got complicated.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before Toyota, I spent five years at Full Sail University handling inbound inquiries and guiding prospective students through enrollment decisions. Same approach: assess their needs, match them with the right program, be honest about costs and expectations. I consistently met enrollment goals while building trust rather than pressure.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your posting mentions warm leads, no cold calls, and a focus on matching customers with the right coverage. That's the environment where I do my best work. I'm comfortable explaining complex products in simple terms, and I genuinely care that customers get what they need.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm based in Orlando, Florida. I have a dedicated home office setup with reliable high-speed internet and experience working remotely. I'm a quick learner with new software systems, and I'm ready to complete whatever licensing and training the role requires.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in insurance product sales and consultative customer service fits what you're looking for.
            </p>
