# Draft a Commit

Look at the changes that are ready to save and write a commit message that's inviting, focused, considerate, supportive, and influential.

## Your Task

1. **Check what changed**
   - Run `git status` to see which files were updated
   - Run `git diff --staged` (or `git diff` if nothing is staged) to see the actual changes
   - Run `git log --oneline -5` to see how recent messages were written

2. **Draft the message following this structure:**

3. **IMPORTANT: Do NOT include the Claude Code attribution footer**
   - Do NOT add `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`
   - Do NOT add `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
   - The message should end with the closing sentence about how it helps people

### Summary Line (under 50 characters)
- Start with an action word: "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove"
- Be specific about what changed
- Capitalize first word, no period at end

### Body (explain what and why)
- Write a brief paragraph explaining WHAT changed and WHY it matters
- Include 2-4 bullet points highlighting key changes or benefits
- End with a sentence about how this helps people

## Tone Guidelines

Make the message:
- **Inviting**: Use "This lets us...", "Now we can..."
- **Focused**: Be specific, avoid vague terms
- **Considerate**: Think about who this helps
- **Supportive**: Explain the reasoning and value
- **Influential**: Connect to bigger goals when relevant

## Example Format

```
Add search box to find books faster

This adds a search feature at the top of every page so visitors can
quickly find books by title, author, or topic without scrolling through
all the categories.

- Search box appears on every page for easy access
- Results appear instantly as you type
- Shows book covers and prices in search results

This makes it easier for customers to find exactly what they want and
helps them discover books they might have missed while browsing.
```

Present the draft commit message and ask if they'd like any adjustments.
