# Need This Done - Design Brief

## Brand Identity

**Purpose**: Professional project services platform that helps people get work done right

**Target Audience**: Professionals and businesses needing reliable project execution

**Brand Personality**:
- Professional and trustworthy (foundation)
- Warm and approachable (not corporate or cold)
- Creative and energetic (not boring or generic)
- Supportive and capable (inspires confidence)

## Current Design Language

**Color Palette**:
- **Primary**: Blue (professional, trustworthy)
- **Accents**: Purple (creativity), Green (success), Orange (energy), Teal (modern), Gray (foundation)
- **Approach**: Soft gradients, warm grayscale undertones

**Typography**:
- **Font**: Inter (clean, readable, modern sans-serif)
- **Scale**: Currently standard, open to more dramatic heading sizes

**Visual Style**:
- Clean, spacious layouts
- Card-based interfaces
- Subtle shadows and borders
- Currently minimal animation

## Design Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

See [docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](../docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) for complete technical standards.

Summary:
- **Accessibility**: 5:1 contrast minimum (WCAG AA)
- **Dark Mode**: All designs must work in both themes
- **Color System**: Extend `app/lib/colors.ts` (don't replace)
- **Testing**: New components need `.a11y.test.tsx` files

## Opportunities for Enhancement

**Encouraged**:
- Subtle animations and micro-interactions
- More dramatic typography scales for key pages
- Creative layouts (asymmetry, grid-breaking, overlapping elements)
- Visual interest (textures, patterns, gradient overlays)
- Distinctive hover states and focus indicators

**Preserve**:
- Professional, trustworthy tone (avoid overly playful aesthetics)
- Existing component APIs and patterns
- Accessibility standards
- Dark mode support

## Plugin Guidance Philosophy

Let the frontend-design plugin suggest aesthetic directions that:
- Add warmth and energy to the professional foundation
- Create distinctive, memorable interfaces
- Avoid generic "AI slop" design patterns
- Maintain accessibility and usability standards
