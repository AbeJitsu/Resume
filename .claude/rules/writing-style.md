# Writing Style Rules

## Punctuation

**Avoid em dashes (—)**
Use these alternatives instead:
- Colons for explanations: "That's what matters: quality over speed"
- Periods for emphasis: "Not optional. Required."
- Commas for light pauses: "My daily workflow includes this, so it's familiar"
- Parentheses for asides: "Based in Orlando (one of your listed locations)"

## Tone

Keep all written content:
- Inviting: "Here's what stands out..." not "I am writing to..."
- Focused: Specific details, not vague claims
- Considerate: Think about who's reading
- Supportive: Explain the why, not just the what
- Influential: Connect to what matters to the reader

**Avoid defensive language** like:
- "handles real traffic and real payments"
- "not just a portfolio piece"
- "something people actually use"
- Any phrasing that sounds like you're proving legitimacy

Let the work speak for itself. If it's production software, just describe what it does.

## Language

- Use language most adults can easily understand
- Speak as if talking to a friend over coffee
- Avoid jargon without context
- Skip generic statements that could apply to anyone
