Hi OneNine,

I use Claude Code every day because it actually changes how I think about problems. Less time fighting syntax, more time on architecture. That's what you're looking for, right? Someone who sees AI as a tool to think clearer, not a shortcut to skip thinking. I've built things end-to-end. Made real choices about how to structure them. Shipped code that doesn't break because I care about the reasoning, not just the output.

I'm the kind of person who sees a problem and solves it, whether it's in the job description or not. I explain why I make decisions so everyone gets it. I own what I build. No finger-pointing, no excuses. The resume shows what that looks like in practice. If you want to build something real, let's talk.
