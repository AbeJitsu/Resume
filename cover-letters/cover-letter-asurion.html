        <div class="greeting">Re: Technical Support & Sales Representative</div>

        <div class="body">
            <p>
                Your "Serve, Solve, Sell" model caught my attention because that's exactly how I've worked for the past 20 years. I've held four call center roles (inbound and outbound), built production software across every platform you support (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android), and spent six years at Toyota closing 25 to 30 deals a month in a role where every dollar was tied to performance. I don't just understand the model. I've lived it.
            </p>

            <p>
                What Asurion needs on every call is someone who can fix the problem and close the sale, not one or the other. At Toyota, my compensation was tied directly to customer satisfaction scores and Google reviews. No happy customer, no bonus. That taught me something important: when you genuinely solve someone's problem first, the sale follows naturally. I brought that same approach to my consulting work, where I landed an 8-month client engagement purely through relationship-based selling. Whether it's walking a customer through a device issue or recommending a protection plan that actually fits their life, I know how to earn trust before asking for the sale.
            </p>

            <p>
                My resume has the full picture. I'd welcome a conversation about how my combination of technical troubleshooting and sales performance fits what your team is building. Let's connect.
