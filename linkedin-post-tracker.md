## What's Working

- **Engagement questions at the end** - Post with question got 101 impressions vs 35 without
- **Bold opening hooks** - "Duct tape and prayers" grabbed attention
- **Short, punchy sentences** - Easy to scan on mobile
- **Your unique path story** - Army medic → Toyota → developer is memorable
- **"Invisible work" angle** - People appreciate seeing behind the scenes

## What Could Improve

- Always end with a question to spark comments
- Use slightly edgier/surprising opening lines
- Keep posts consistent length (the shorter ones seem to do better)
- Reference needthisdone.com naturally, not just as a link dump

**Platform-Specific Stories:**

## Post Template That Works

```
[Surprising or thought-provoking opening line]

[2-3 short sentences expanding on it]

[What you actually did/built - use arrows → for lists]

[Why this matters to the reader]

[Call to action + link]

[Engagement question]
```

## Best Posting Practices

- Keep paragraphs short (1-2 sentences max)
- Use line breaks liberally
- End with a question
- Link to needthisdone.com
- Mention you're looking for opportunities
