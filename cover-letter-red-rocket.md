Dear Red Rocket Studios Team,

I'm applying for your Web Designer position. I build responsive websites that look good and work well, and I'd love to bring that to your creative team.

**What I bring:**

My foundation is solid HTML and CSS. I've been writing it for years, and I understand how to structure pages that load fast, scale across devices, and stay accessible. JavaScript is part of my daily workflow, whether I'm building interactive components in React or adding custom functionality to a page.

I design in the browser, iterating with dev tools until it looks right. I'm comfortable in Figma when collaboration calls for it. I've worked with Bootstrap and WordPress, and I pick up new frameworks quickly because my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals are solid.

**Why this role fits:**

At my consulting practice, I've learned that design work is really about listening. My best client relationships started small and grew because I communicated clearly and delivered what I said I would. That pattern of earning trust through consistent work is what I'd bring to Red Rocket.

Before tech, I spent seven years at Toyota where tight deadlines were the norm. I know how to balance quality with speed when multiple projects are running at once.

I'd welcome the chance to show you my portfolio and discuss how I can contribute to your team's creative projects.

Best,
Abe Reyes
