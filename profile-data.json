That means responsive interfaces in React and Next.js, APIs in Node.js, databases that scale, and infrastructure that doesn't break at 2am. When AI makes sense for your project, I build RAG systems with semantic search, vector databases, and responses grounded in your data.\n\nNeed data from somewhere it doesn't want to go? I build web scraping pipelines that collect, clean, and feed information into whatever system needs it. Need manual processes to disappear? I write automation that handles the repetitive work so your team can focus on what matters.\n\nWhat I bring beyond the technical:\n\nI ask the right questions before writing code. Years of high-pressure decision-making taught me that understanding the problem saves everyone time and money. I think about who's using what I build, not just whether it works, but whether it makes sense to them.\n\nI communicate clearly because I've spent years translating complex information for people who aren't technical. I document my work so the next person isn't guessing. I meet deadlines because I've worked in environments where missing them wasn't an option.\n\nIf you're looking for a developer who ships reliable software and is genuinely easy to work with, let's connect. I'd love to hear what you're building.",
