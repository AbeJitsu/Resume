## Full Stack Developer | needthisdone.com

**November 2025 - Present**

When I left my corporate job to build something of my own, I wanted to prove I could ship real software that solves real problems. needthisdone.com is that proof.

The platform handles everything a professional services business needs: customers browse services, book appointments, pay securely, and manage their accounts. Behind the scenes, there's an admin dashboard, automated emails, and an AI chatbot that actually understands context.

Building this meant making hundreds of architectural decisions. I chose Next.js for the frontend because it handles both static and dynamic content well. Supabase for the database because it's PostgreSQL with a great developer experience. Medusa for commerce because headless architecture lets me customize everything. Redis for caching because pages need to load fast.

The visual page builder might be the feature I'm proudest of. Non-technical users can drag building blocks around, edit text directly on the page, and undo mistakes. Content changes don't require a developer. That's the kind of system that scales a business.

I wrote 137 automated tests because shipping bugs to customers isn't acceptable. The test suite simulates real users clicking through checkout flows, booking appointments, and managing their accounts. If something breaks, I know before customers do.

This project shows what I can do when I own the entire stack. Frontend to backend to deployment. Design decisions to database schemas to CI/CD pipelines.

## Technical Operations Specialist | Acadio

**Spring 2025 - Winter 2025**

I joined Acadio as a contractor doing API integration work. Within weeks, the scope expanded because I kept solving problems that weren't in my job description.

Acadio builds learning management software for financial certifications. When I arrived, the team was drowning in manual data work. Client onboarding meant days of reformatting content. Study materials came in as messy Word docs, scattered PDFs, and Excel files that needed to be transformed into something the platform could use.

I automated most of it. Python scripts that convert textbooks from PDF to clean HTML. Validation pipelines that catch formatting errors before they reach learners. Data migrations that used to take days now finished the same day with better accuracy.

The CEO started bringing me his technical questions because I could explain things in plain language. That's not a small thing at an early-stage startup where the founder needs to understand what the engineering team is building.

I also built tools for clients directly. Excel macros and VBA scripts that automated their repetitive data tasks. Web scraping infrastructure that collected FINRA regulations and fed them into AI systems generating study content at scale.

What I learned here: the most valuable skills aren't always the flashiest. Sometimes it's just making messy data usable so other people can do their jobs.

## Freelance Web Developer | Self-Employed

**January 2023 - March 2024**

This is where the transition happened. I'd been learning web development for years while working full-time at Toyota, building small projects, following tutorials, studying documentation. Freelancing was the step from hobby to profession.

I built websites and automation tools for clients. Each project taught me something: how to scope work, how to communicate with non-technical clients, how to handle the inevitable "can you also add..." requests that come after you've agreed on a price.

The technical skills mattered, but the business skills mattered more. Delivering on time. Explaining tradeoffs. Managing expectations. These are the same skills I'd developed over seven years in automotive finance, just applied to a different domain.

By the end of this period, I wasn't studying tutorials anymore. I was building things clients paid for and used.

## Finance and Insurance Manager | Toyota of Orlando

**Spring 2017 - Winter 2023**

Seven years, three roles, one dealership. I started on the sales floor and finished as an F&I Manager, earning each promotion by doing the current job well enough that the next one made sense.

Toyota of Orlando moves 10-30 cars daily. High volume means high pressure. Every customer interaction matters because there's always another customer waiting. You learn to work efficiently without cutting corners, to explain complex information without losing people, to handle objections without getting defensive.

As F&I Manager, I worked with 3-7 customers daily. Each one involved walking them through financing options, protection products, and payment structures. I built relationships with multiple lenders and learned to structure deals that worked for everyone.

The teammates who brought me their complicated deals told me something about how I was perceived. When a deal had weird credit, unusual trade situations, or customers who didn't trust anyone, they came to me. That trust wasn't given; it was earned through consistently finding solutions.

What transfers to software development: breaking down complex information for people who aren't experts. Staying calm when problems arise. Following through on commitments. Understanding that the person on the other side of the table has their own concerns, and addressing those concerns directly.

## Military Enrollment Counselor | Full Sail University

**2012 - 2017**

I started in International Admissions, helping prospective students from around the world navigate American higher education. These conversations required patience and cultural awareness. Families were making decisions from thousands of miles away about programs they'd never seen in person.

My Army background opened a door to the Military department. As a veteran, I had credibility with service members that civilian counselors didn't. I understood what they were going through because I'd been there.

The work was career transition counseling disguised as enrollment. Service members and their families needed to understand how GI Bill benefits worked, what programs fit their schedules, and how education could help them build civilian careers. These weren't sales conversations. They were life-planning conversations.

Consistently meeting enrollment goals while maintaining integrity isn't a contradiction. When you genuinely help people make good decisions, the numbers take care of themselves.

## Combat Medic, Corporal (E-4) | U.S. Army

**1996 - 2001**

Five years as an Army paramedic at Fort Hood and Fort Bragg. I led a team of three medics and two combat lifesavers, delivering emergency care in environments where mistakes cost lives and hesitation wasn't an option.

Military medicine teaches you things that civilian life rarely does. You learn to stay calm when everything around you is chaos. You learn to follow protocols precisely because the protocols exist for good reasons. You learn that leadership means taking responsibility for your team's performance, not just your own.

The discipline and systematic thinking from this experience show up in everything I've done since. When I write tests before code, that's the same mindset as checking equipment before it's needed. When I document systems so others can maintain them, that's the same principle as training your replacement. When I stay calm during a production incident, that's muscle memory from a different kind of emergency.

I graduated in the top 10% of my class at the Army Medical Department Center & School. That mattered less than what came after: five years of applying what I'd learned under real pressure.
