Dear Hiring Team,

I'm applying for the Web Applications Programmer position. I design, develop, and maintain web applications with a focus on quality, and I'd be a good fit for this role.

**What I bring:**

I have hands-on experience with Vue.js. My first e-commerce platform was built with Vue on the frontend and Express on the backend, handling products, orders, and user management. I've since expanded into React and Next.js, but Vue remains comfortable territory.

Third-party integrations are part of my regular work. I've integrated payment processing (Stripe), external APIs, and data exchange services. I test thoroughly, document clearly, and build with maintainability in mind.

I'm comfortable with the full development lifecycle: gathering requirements, designing solutions, writing code, reviewing peers' work, and supporting applications after deployment. When complex issues come up, I dig in and find the root cause.

**Why this role fits:**

I live in Orlando and I'm looking for contract work where I can contribute to a team. Before tech, I spent seven years at Toyota where I earned three promotions and regularly mentored junior staff on processes and best practices. That experience translates directly to collaborating across teams and helping others grow.

Code reviews and development standards matter to me. They make the whole team more effective, and I appreciate working in environments that value them.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute to your projects.

Best,
Abe Reyes
