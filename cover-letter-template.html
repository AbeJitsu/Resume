        RE: [ROLE] Position

        <!-- INVITING: Hook them, show genuine interest in THIS role -->
        <p>
            [Opening that connects to what makes this specific role interesting. What caught your attention? Why does their mission or problem matter?]
        </p>

        <!-- FOCUSED: What you bring, specific to what they need -->
        <p>
            I bring 25 years of working with technology in business environments. At Acadio, I started as a contractor doing API integration work and quickly became the person the CEO came to with technical questions - he said my explanations just made sense to him. I designed automated workflows to eliminate manual processes, built scripts to convert messy PDF content into clean formats, and created Excel macros for clients who needed to automate repetitive data tasks. When client onboarding took multiple days, I turned it into same-day completions.
        </p>

        <!-- CONSIDERATE: Show you understand their situation -->
        <p>
            [Show you understand what they're looking for. What intersection of skills matters for this role? How does your background fit what they need?]
        </p>

        <!-- SUPPORTIVE: Back it up with proof -->
        <p>
            My current project, needthisdone.com, is a production application where I've built AI automation including a chatbot with custom prompts, integrated payment and email systems, and designed workflows that let non-technical users update content without touching code. I use AI tools daily for development - not just chatting, but integrated prompt engineering and workflow automation. [Add role-specific proof if relevant.]
        </p>

        <!-- INFLUENTIAL: Clear next step -->
        <p>
            I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my experience [designing workflows / building software / etc.] could help [COMPANY]. I'm ready to contribute from day one.
